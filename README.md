## How it Works

The VAC Error Fix Tool performs the following steps to resolve the VAC error:

1. **Checking CS:GO**: The tool checks if CS:GO (or any other Valve game) is open and closes it if necessary.

2. **Closing Steam**: The tool closes the Steam client to prepare for the fix process.

3. **Resetting Steam Credentials**: It clears current Steam login credentials from the registry.

4. **Reopening Steam**: The Steam client will prompt you to log in again.

5. **Waiting for Steam Login**: The tool waits for the Steam login prompt to appear.

6. **Closing Steam Again**: Steam is closed again after successful login.

7. **Restoring Steam Credentials**: Your original Steam login credentials are restored.

8. **Enabling Remember Password**: The "Remember Password" option is enabled for convenience.

9. **Reopening the Game**: The game is reopened if it was previously opened.
